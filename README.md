# NPM Package Starter

This repository is a npm package starter for me. It's extremely simple to use and feel free to use it as well.

You can use Typescript and Jest to make your packages great for the user and test before you deploy.

Export the functions you want to include in the npm package in ```lib/index.ts```.

Write your Jest tests in the ```test/``` directory.

Do incorporate Travis CI, add environment variables in your Travis CI project settings. Include your email and token. Get a token at https://www.npmjs.com/settings/(username)/tokens.
